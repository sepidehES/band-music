                        <h4>David Johansen Biography</h4>
    
                        <p>Best known for his tenure fronting the hugely influential New York Dolls, David Johansen was a true chameleon; throughout the course of a career which saw him transform from a lipstick-smeared proto-punk hero into an urbane blue-eyed soul man and finally into a tuxedo-clad lounge lizard, he remained a rock & roll original, an unpredictable iconoclast and a true cultural innovator.</p>

                        <p>Born January 9, 1950, in Staten Island, NY, Johansen joined his first band, the Vagabond Missionaries, in his mid-teens. A tenure with Fast Eddie & the Electric Japs, as well as an attempt to mount a career as a theatrical actor, followed before a club-hopping Johansen met bassist Arthur Kane, who extended an invitation to join his band, Actress. After changing their name to the New York Dolls, the group began building a notorious reputation for their menacing, edgy music, drug-fueled lifestyle, and outrageously campy, drag queen-inspired glam image; although neither their eponymous 1973 debut nor 1974's Too Much Too Soon even cracked the Top 100, the Dolls established an enduring cult following, and their influence on the rise of punk was unmistakable.</p>
                        
                        <p>The Dolls officially broke up in 1975, although Johansen and guitarist Syl Sylvain continued performing under the group's name for two more years. Finally, in 1977, Johansen entered the recording studio with his support group, the Staten Island Boys, to cut his self-titled solo debut; while it sold no better than the Dolls' records, it did renew the critics' love affair with the singer and his gritty, soulful voice.</p>
                        
                        <p>With producer Mick Ronson, he returned in 1979 with the Motown-influenced In Style, followed in 1981 by the commercial-minded Here Comes the Night. While 1982's concert set Live It Up won some airplay for its medley of the Animals hits "We Gotta Get Out of This Place," "It's My Life," and "Don't Bring Me Down," Johansen was forced to reassess his career when 1984's dance-flavored Sweet Revenge tanked.</p>
                        
                        <p>At the end of 1984 he resurfaced in the pompadoured guise of Buster Poindexter, a supposed ethnomusicologist armed with an expansive knowledge of R&B chestnuts. After debuting the Buster character at a series of mid-'80s downtown New York loft gigs with the Uptown Horns, Johansen continued honing the identity in the piano bars of Manhattan, establishing a lounge swinger persona which predated the lounge-kitsch revival of the mid-'90s by a decade.</p>
                        
                        <p>As Poindexter's popularity grew, he began fronting a large band dubbed the Banshees in Blue and building a devoted following on the New York club circuit. In 1987, he issued an LP, Buster Poindexter, which featured the party classic "Hot Hot Hot," an effervescent cover of an obscure 1984 soca hit.</p>
                        
                        <p>In addition to reviving Johansen's career as a musical performer, Buster also renewed his long-dormant acting bug, and he was tapped to co-star in the 1988 features Married to the Mob and Scrooged. The character remained Johansen's focus in subsequent years as well, as evidenced by the albums Buster Goes Berserk in 1989 and Buster's Happy Hour in 1994.</p>
                        
                        <p>He maintained a relatively low profile in the years prior to the spring 2000 release of David Johansen & the Harry Smiths.</p>

                        <h4>Jerry Nolan Biography</h4>
    
                        <p>
                            Sylvain left his group with Nolan to form the Dolls, who by 1972 had built an incredible following in New York City with their androgynous image and trashy Stones-esque party rock. The group (which also included singer David Johansen, bassist Arthur Kane, drummer Billy Murcia, plus guitarists Johnny Thunders and Sylvain) was invited to open a series of shows for the Faces in England toward the end of 1972, despite the fact that they hadn't even signed a recording contract.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            But what should have been an exciting time for the group turned out to be a tragic one, as Murcia died mid-tour from asphyxiation. Broken-hearted, the group returned home but soon decided to carry on with Nolan taking Murcia's spot. The Dolls immediately signed on with Mercury Records, who issued a pair of releases over the next two years: 1973's self-titled debut and 1974's Too Much Too Soon. Although neither album sold particularly well, both have become certified rock classics over the years, inspiring countless bands of various musical genres (including '70s punk, '80s glam metal, etc.).
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Nolan and Thunders left the group in 1975 (both were addicted to hard drugs and disillusioned with the Dolls' unfocused direction) and formed the Heartbreakers. The new group issued L.A.M.F. in 1977, which like the Dolls' albums went underappreciated upon its initial release but has since become a punk classic.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Once again, certain habits were hard to break, as drugs played a major part in breaking up this promising band after only a single release (Nolan and Thunders remained friends, however, and would regroup the Heartbreakers for numerous reunion tours over the years, documented on such releases as Live at Max's Kansas City '79 and Live at the Lyceum Ballroom 1984).
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Nolan was subsequently a part of a series of bands/projects, including the Idols with former Doll Arthur Kane, backing Sid Vicious at a Max's Kansas City show (released as the Sid Sings and Never Mind the Reunion...Here's Sid Vicious albums), and a group called the London Cowboys, who released the album On Stage in 1985.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Thunders died in April of 1991 due to a drug overdose, which left Nolan without his longtime partner in crime and incredibly depressed (although Nolan did appear at a Thunders tribute concert in N.Y.C. alongside his former Doll and Heartbreaker bandmates).
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Toward the end of the same year, Nolan fell ill with bacterial meningitis and bacterial pneumonia, which led to a fatal stroke on January 14, 1992.

                        <h4>Johnny Thunders Biography</h4>
                        <p>
                            Johnny Thunders was the first punk rock guitar hero, earning a cult following for his noisy but epic style a few years before the insouciant new music gained its name. Following in the footsteps of his idol and role model Keith Richards, Johnny Thunders (born John Anthony Genzale, Jr.) lived the ultimate rock & roll life, spending most of his days churning out tough, sloppy three-chord rock & roll and gaining nearly as strong a reputation for his decades-long struggle with addiction as for his music. Thunders made his greatest impact as a member of the New York Dolls, the proto-punk glam rockers of the early '70s. During the late '70s, he was a familiar figure on the New York punk scene, both with his band the Heartbreakers and as a solo artist. Thunders performed and recorded steadily until his death in 1991, turning out a series of records that inadvertently documented the struggles of his life and his art. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Under the name Johnny Volume, Genzale began performing in high school with local combos Johnny & the Jaywalkers and the Reign (an unreleased Reign tune recorded in 1967 was released as a single after Thunders' death); after those bands ran their course, he joined Actress, which featured future Dolls Arthur Kane and Billy Murcia. Actress became the New York Dolls in 1971, with the addition of vocalist David Johansen, and Genzale renamed himself Johnny Thunders. After recording two acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful albums, the Dolls broke up. In 1975, Thunders and the group's drummer Jerry Nolan formed the Heartbreakers with former Television bassist Richard Hell and guitarist Walter Lure. Hell left the group shortly afterward to form the Voidoids and was replaced by Billy Rath. With Thunders leading the band, the Heartbreakers toured America and Britain, releasing one official album, L.A.M.F., in 1977. The group relocated to the U.K., where their popularity was significantly greater than it was in the U.S., particularly on the burgeoning punk scene. Thunders earned a reputation for powerful but inconsistent performances -- solid and rollicking one night, incoherent, sloppy, and drunken the next, sometimes veering between the two extremes in a single evening. After several months, the group returned to America, where they played a series of farewell gigs in New York. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thunders went solo in 1978, recording So Alone with various rock and punk celebrities, including the Sex Pistols' Steve Jones and Paul Cook, Steve Marriott (Small Faces, Humble Pie), Peter Perrett (Only Ones), Paul Gray (Eddie and the Hot Rods, the Damned), and Thin Lizzy's Phil Lynott. After its release, Thunders and Peter Perrett played in the short-lived band Living Dead, while in 1980 Thunders teamed up with MC5 guitarist Wayne Kramer in the band Gang Wars, another project that soon fizzled out. During the early '80s, Thunders re-formed the Heartbreakers for various tours and periodic "farewell" shows in New York City, with their stage work documented on a series of live albums, often of dubious legality.

                            For most of the '80s, the only Johnny Thunders product available consisted of haphazard compilations of live tracks and demos. In 1984, Thunders rebounded with a surprisingly strong acoustic album, Hurt Me, followed in 1985 by Que Sera, Sera, a collection of new songs that showed he could still perform convincingly. Three years later, the guitarist recorded an album of rock and R&B covers with vocalist Patti Palladin, Copy Cats. And in 1991, German punk band Die Toten Hosen paid homage to Thunders by inviting him to play guitar on a cover of the Heartbreakers' "Born to Lose" on their album Learning English: Lesson One.

                            After recording with Die Toten Hosen, Thunders settled in New Orleans, where he planned to cut an album with local jazz and R&B musicians. However, only a few days later, Thunders was found dead in his room at the St. Peter House on April 23, 1991. Thunders' passing was shrouded in rumor and uncertainty; while it was widely believed he overdosed on drugs, friends insisted the guitarist was weaning himself off heroin with methadone, while others believed he was the victim of sadistic burglars who ransacked his room after feeding him LSD, and still others reported Thunders was struggling with an untreated case of leukemia. Though Thunders' passing was strange and chaotic, it was curiously appropriate -- no other rock & roller ever lived as hard and traveled as individual a path as Johnny Thunders.

                            <h4>Sylvain Sylvain Biography</h4>
        
                            <p>
                                Sylvain Sylvain was born Sylvain Sylvain Mizrahi in Cairo, Egypt on February 14, 1951. His father's family were Sephardic Jews who had left Turkey to settle in Egypt, and his mother was of Syrian heritage. In 1956, Egyptian president Gamal Nasser instituted a purge during the Suez Canal crisis that led to Egypt's Jewish citizens evacuating the country, and the Mizrahi family fled first to France, and then to the United States. As a teenager in Queens, New York, Sylvain struck up a friendship with Billy Murcia, who was born in Colombia. The two started a clothing company, Truth & Soul, and they decided to form a band, with Sylvain on guitar and Murcia on drums. After spending a few months in Amsterdam, Sylvain returned to New York to discover the band, now dubbed Actress, had replaced him. In time, guitarist Rick Rivets was out, Sylvain was back in, and joined by Murcia, guitarist Johnny Thunders, bassist Arthur Kane, and vocalist David Johansen, the group became the New York Dolls, and began playing out in early 1972. The New York Dolls were something new and different on the Big Apple rock scene, playing sloppy but bracing hard rock infused with wit and street smarts, while their stage dress reflected a trashy, vital sexual ambiguity that was a curiously effective match for the aggression of their music. In July 1973, the Dolls issued their self-titled first album (by which time tragedy had already touched the group, as Billy Murcia had died from a drug-related incident while the band was in England to open dates for Queen, to be replaced by Jerry Nolan), and their sound and image polarized the mainstream rock audience -- in Creem Magazine''s 1973 readers' poll, they were named both "Best New Band" and "Worst Band" by their voters. The group's taste for drugs, alcohol, and high living took its toll, and by April 1975, Thunders had dropped out of the group. Sylvain and Johansen attempted to hold the group together, but after various makeshift lineups, the band finally collapsed at the close of 1976. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Following the Dolls' breakup, Sylvain continued to work with Johansen, playing on his first two solo albums (1978's David Johansen and 1979's In Style) and often sitting in with his road band. At the same time, Sylvain began gigging with a new band, the Criminals, which included featuring Bobby Blain on keyboards, Michael Page on bass, and Tony Machine on drums. (Blain and Machine had both served in the latter-day post-Thunders Dolls.) In 1980, Sylvain launched a solo career in earnest, signing with RCA and releasing his self-titled debut album, which earned good reviews but few sales. His second album, 1981's Syl Sylvain and the Teardrops, debuted a new band, with Sylvain on guitar, Danny "Tubby" Reid on bass, and Rosie Rex on drums. While the Teardrops were a popular live attraction in New York, the album didn't register with critics or fans, and it was Sylvain's last effort for RCA. He released an independent single in 1983 ("Out with the Wrong Woman" b/w "I Love a Little Pussy"), and a short-lived duo with Rosie Rex called Roman Sandals issued one single in 1984. Sylvain dropped out of music for the most part during the late '80s and relocated to Los Angeles. In 1998, he re-emerged with a new solo album, (Sleep) Baby Doll, which included guitar work from Blondie's Frank Infante. Issued by the independent Fishhead label, the album was well received by critics, and it was released in a revised edition called Paper, Pencil & Glue by the Spanish label Munster in 2000. Also in 2000, Fishhead brought out Sylvain Sylvain...In Teenage News, a collection of recordings with the Criminals from the early '80s.

                                In 2004, the surviving members of the New York Dolls -- Sylvain, David Johansen, and Arthur Kane -- were persuaded by Morrissey to play a reunion show for that year's Meltdown Festival in London, which was curated by the former Smiths vocalist. (Johnny Thunders had died in 1991, and Jerry Nolan passed in 1992.) The concert was well-received, and the Dolls decided to return to duty, even though Kane died several weeks after the Meltdown appearance (which was recorded and released as The Return of the New York Dolls: Live from Royal Festival Hall, 2004). In 2006, Sylvain, Johansen, and a handful of new sidemen issued the first New York Dolls studio album in over three decades, One Day It Will Please Us to Remember Even This, followed in 2008 by 'Cause I Sez So and 2011 by Dancing Backward in High Heels. (The reunited Dolls also brought out two official live discs, 2008's Live at the Fillmore East, December 28 & 29, 2007 and 2011's Live from the Bowery 2011.) In 2010, Sylvain debuted a short-lived band, the Batusis, which paired him with another proto-punk icon, Cheetah Chrome of the Dead Boys; they issued a self-titled EP on Smog Veil Records that year. For the remainder of the decade, Sylvain primarily focused on live work, though he did make cameo appearances on Cheetah Chrome's 2013 EP Solo and 2019's Detroit Breakout by Mitch Ryder. By the time Ryder's album came out, Sylvain was in treatment for cancer; he would battle the disease for more than two years before he died on January 13, 2021 at the age of 69.

                        <p>Billy Murcia (October 9, 1951 – November 6, 1972) was the original drummer for the New York Dolls.</p>
                        <p>Murcia was born in Bogotá, Colombia, and raised in Jackson Heights, New York, United States.</p>
                        <p>He and Sylvain Sylvain both attended Quintano's School for Young Professionals in the late sixties. It was at Quintano's that they met Johnny Thunders, also a student there. They made their musical debut in 1967 in a band called "The Pox". They owned and co-managed a clothing business called "Truth and Soul". Murcia was a fundamental ingredient of the original New York Dolls sound and played during their now-legendary series of weekly shows at the Mercer Arts Center.</p>
                        <p>While on a brief tour of England in 1972, Murcia was invited to a party where he passed out from an accidental heroin overdose. In an attempt to revive him, he was put in a bathtub and force-fed coffee, which resulted in asphyxiation and death. He died before the New York Dolls recorded their first album and was later replaced by Jerry Nolan in 1973. The final gig of their tour, at the Manchester Hardrock, was canceled, and the band flew back to New York City. Murcia can be heard playing live with the New York Dolls on Lipstick Killers: The Mercer Street Sessions.</p>
                        <p>Johnny Thunders wrote a song called "Billy Boy" in honor of his friend and former band member. It was recorded on Que Sera Sera in 1985.</p>
                        <p>The song "Time" from David Bowie's Aladdin Sane album references Murcia and his untimely demise.</p>

                        <h4>Blackie Lawless Biography</h4>
    
                        <p>
                            Steven Edward Duren (born September 4, 1956), better known by his stage name Blackie Lawless, is an American singer, songwriter and musician, best known as the lead singer and rhythm guitarist (formerly bassist) for heavy metal band W.A.S.P.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Duren was born in Tampa, Florida,[3] and raised in Staten Island, New York City.[4] He had a fundamentalist Baptist upbringing, but has also claimed Jewish ancestry.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He has said that he was "very active" in church as a youth and was born again at age 11. In his late teens, Duren strayed from the church and became interested in the occult. Although he would only study occultism for a short time before leaving that too,[6] he continued to use themes of occultism up until his return to the Christian faith in recent years
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He claims Irish, French and Native American ancestry (his mother self-identified as one-quarter Blackfoot).[7] He is the nephew of the late Major League Baseball pitcher, Ryne Duren.[8] Lawless himself considered pursuing a professional baseball career; however, he ultimately opted for music. He credits his older brother with introducing him to the guitar.

                        <h4>Earl Slick Biography</h4>
    
                        <p>
                            Best-known as one of David Bowie's guitarists (during one of his most successful periods commercially -- the mid-'70s), Earl Slick has gone on to play on a variety of other projects before returning back to Bowie in the early 21st century. Slick (then only 22 years old), came out of virtually nowhere to serve as Bowie's first proper replacement for Mick Ronson after Bowie had spilt up the Spiders from Mars. Although Bowie supplied most of the guitar work for his hit 1974 release, Diamond Dogs, he sought the then-unknown Slick to replicate his and Ronson's previous guitar parts on tour. Not only did Slick duplicate them, but the incredibly versatile guitarist managed to expand on them and inject his own style into the tunes, resulting in one of the greatest rock guitar albums of all time (albeit usually woefully overlooked), David Live, recorded at a stop at the Tower Theater in Philadelphia. Slick remained with Bowie for his next two studio albums, which saw the singer transform into his "Thin White Duke" persona and take on the funk genre, resulting in the classic full-lengths Young Americans (1975) and the more experimental Station to Station (1976), as well as the hit singles "Fame" and "Golden Years."

                            Leaving Bowie's band just as the singer decided to pack his bags and relocate to Germany, Slick continued on as a "gun for hire," as he appeared on Leo Sayer's Top Ten 1976 release, Endless Flight (which spawned the schmaltz hits "When I Need You" and "You Make Me Feel Like Dancing"), ex-Mott the Hoople singer Ian Hunter's 1977 solo outing, Overnight Angels, and also releases by such obscure hard rock outfits as Bad Boy and Tonio K. Also during this time, Slick attempted briefly to launch a solo career, resulting in such releases as Razor Sharp and Earl Slick Band. Up next for Slick was one of the high points of his entire career -- working alongside John Lennon on what would become Lennon's final all-new studio recording, 1980's chart-topping Double Fantasy. After Lennon's death the same year, Slick returned to the studio with Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, and appeared on what would become her highest-charting solo release, 1981's harrowing Season of Glass (Slick's guitar work would also appear on the posthumously released compilation of Lennon leftovers, 1984's Milk and Honey, as well as CD box sets for both Ono, 1992's Onobox, and Lennon, 1998's Anthology).

                            The early to mid-'80s saw Slick return briefly to Bowie's band (for the sold-out Serious Moonlight world tour in support of 1983's Let's Dance), and also virtually replacing Brian Setzer in the Stray Cats, as he joined up with ex-Cats Lee Rocker (bass) and Slim Jim Phantom (drums) in the trio Phantom, Rocker & Slick. The short-lived outfit issued a pair of moderately successful albums, 1985's Phantom, Rocker & Slick and 1986's Cover Girl, before disbanding. Slick would appear on other artists' releases throughout the late '80s/early '90s, although he took a break from the music biz to sort out his personal life (allegedly to kick a serious drug problem). Slick returned stronger than ever, as he founded his own record label, Slick Music Inc., which specializes in solo releases by Slick (2000's Lost and Found), as well as archival releases by other artists (Fanny, Kasim Sulton, etc.). In 2000, Slick accepted an offer to rejoin Bowie full-time, as he toured steadily with his previous employer and appeared on his 2002 studio effort, Heathen. David Bowie, The Cure's Robert Smith, Joe Elliott of Def Leppard and others joined him for Zig Zag, which appeared on Sanctuary in fall 2003.
